# Implementation of VGG16

Beside the comments in the code itself, I also wrote an article 
which you can find [here](https://mohitjain.me/2018/06/07/vggnet/) with further explanations on VGGNet.

## Content

- `vgg16.py`: Class with the graph definition of the VGG16.
- `VGG16 Train.ipynb`: Notebook to train and test the implementation of VGG16.
